# What is Photoshop?
Photoshop is an image creation, graphic design and photo editing software developed by Adobe. The software provides many image editing features for pixel-based images, raster graphics and vector graphics.
# How does Photoshop work?
Photoshop has been the industry standard image manipulation program for so long that its name has become a verb. It is common parlance to say that an image has been "photoshopped," or even just "shopped," meaning that it's been edited or manipulated.
It uses a layer-based editing system that enables raster image creation and altering with multiple overlays that support transparency.
Layers can also act as masks or filters, changing underlying colors. Shadows and other effects can be added to the layers.
Adobe promotes Photoshop as a tool for professionals. However, beginners can use Photoshop as well with many helpful tutorials on the market that train users in how to use Photoshop's various features.
